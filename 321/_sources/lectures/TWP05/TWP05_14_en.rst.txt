Desktop testing or simulation
=================================

+ Understanding that the value of variables can change during program execution is not so natural, but it is fundamental when programming
+ A program cannot be read as text, but carefully analyzing line by line
+ You can practice with pencil, eraser, and paper


.. table:: **Desktop testing or simulation**
   :widths: auto
   :align: left

   debt  purchase Screen

   -0-    -100-    600
   -100-  -200-
