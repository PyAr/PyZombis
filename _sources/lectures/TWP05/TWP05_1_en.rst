First program
=================

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print("hello world!")
    hello world!

+ This program has only one line of code
+ Note that the quotes do not appear in the output
+ We need to mark or delimit the beginning and end of our messages with a symbol, in this case, quotes

**Now you try it on your own!**

+ Type ``print("first message")`` in the interpreter below and check that you receive the output of your message without quotes.
