What types of errors?
======================

+ Syntax errors: a programming language is formal, different from natural languages, and has a rigid syntax.
+ Runtime errors
+ Semantic errors (more difficult to find)


How to find and handle errors?
-------------------------------

+ Syntax: pay close attention and practice
+ During runtime: exception handling
+ Semantic: desk testing or simulation


So, how do you run your code?
------------------------------

+ There are two things to run the guessing game program: an editor and an interpreter
+ The editor saves the code written in a file on the disk

+ Computers cannot process text because they only understand binary (zeros and ones)
+ The interpreter converts the source code into a binary file for the computer

+ The Python interpreter works in two modes: interactive and editing.
+ The interactive mode is ideal for testing commands and getting instant responses
+ However, the editing mode is the most commonly used for developing programs.
   + File names usually end with ".py"
   + If you use another extension, you'll lose colors...
+ A program is more than a list of commands.
