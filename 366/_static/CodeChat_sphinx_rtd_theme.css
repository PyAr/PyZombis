   ******************************************************************
   |docname| - Style sheet for CodeChat with the `ReadTheDocs theme`_
   ******************************************************************
   This style sheet fixes the size of CodeChat's indent so that code and comments line up when using the `ReadTheDocs theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. This is only needed for the `ReadTheDocs theme`_. To use it, add the following to your project's ``conf.py``:

   .. code-block::
    :linenos:

    html_css_files = ['CodeChat_sphinx_rtd_theme.css']
 */
div.CodeChat-indent {
    font-size: 10pt;
}
