|docname| - Style sheet for CodeChat documents
**********************************************
This is a style sheet for use with CodeChat's extensions to Docutils/Sphinx.

The overall goal is to allow comments (everything but ``<pre>`` tags) to appear with normal (double) spacing, while comments and code are single spaced.

This import will cause an error if the Docutils ``html4css1`` style sheet is embedded instead of linked, though the page still displays without problems. However, omitting it will cause the linked style sheet case to fail, so leave this in.
*/
@import url(html4css1.css);

/* Remove all top and bottom space around ``<pre>``, making it single-spaced. Also, remove the border so that code and comments mix more naturally. */
