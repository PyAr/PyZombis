What is a program?
====================

+ A detailed set of instructions, step by step, that tells the computer what to do.
+ If we change the program, the computer will do something different
+ The computer remains the same, but the program has changed.
+ Programs are executed.
+ Software (programs) controls hardware.
+ The process of creating software is called programming.
+ An algorithm is a step-by-step recipe for solving a computational problem.

Programming languages
-------------------------
+ Low-level languages are the closest to the machine:
    + Assembler:
        + Load the number of variables A into the CPU.
        + Load the number of variables B into the CPU.
        + Add the two numbers in the CPU.
        + Store the result in variable C.
+ Original high-level language command: C = A + B.
+ Compilers convert high-level language to specific computer machine language.
+ Interpreters parse and execute the program instruction by instruction in the computer's machine language.
